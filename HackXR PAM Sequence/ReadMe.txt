Project: Visualizing PAM recognitions sequences 

To conduct CRISPR experiments, guide RNA/DNA constructs need to be made for the correct gene to be targeted. These sequences have been found to have off 
target effects which vary based on the sequence itself. Since sequences high in G and C are found to be more accurate, we wanted to create a visual interface to visualize PAM identifying sequences and their complements.
